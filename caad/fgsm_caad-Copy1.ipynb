    "\n",
    "For context, there are many categories of adversarial attacks, each with\n",
    "a different goal and assumption of the attacker’s knowledge. However, in\n",
    "general the overarching goal is to add the least amount of perturbation\n",
    "to the input data to cause the desired misclassification. There are\n",
    "several kinds of assumptions of the attacker’s knowledge, two of which\n",
    "are: **white-box** and **black-box**. A *white-box* attack assumes the\n",
    "attacker has full knowledge and access to the model, including\n",
    "architecture, inputs, outputs, and weights. A *black-box* attack assumes\n",
    "the attacker only has access to the inputs and outputs of the model, and\n",
    "knows nothing about the underlying architecture or weights. There are\n",
    "also several types of goals, including **misclassification** and\n",
    "**source/target misclassification**. A goal of *misclassification* means\n",
    "the adversary only wants the output classification to be wrong but does\n",
    "not care what the new classification is. A *source/target\n",
    "misclassification* means the adversary wants to alter an image that is\n",
    "originally of a specific source class so that it is classified as a\n",
    "specific target class.\n",

    "In this case, the FGSM attack is a *white-box* attack with the goal of\n",

    "## Fast Gradient Sign Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first and most popular adversarial attacks to date is\n",

    "by Goodfellow et. al. in [Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial\n",

    "powerful, and yet intuitive. It is designed to attack neural networks by\n",
    "leveraging the way they learn, *gradients*. The idea is simple, rather\n",
    "than working to minimize the loss by adjusting the weights based on the\n",
    "backpropagated gradients, the attack *adjusts the input data to maximize\n",
    "the loss* based on the same backpropagated gradients. In other words,\n",
    "the attack uses the gradient of the loss w.r.t the input data, then\n",

    "$\\nabla_{x} J(\\mathbf{\\theta}, \\mathbf{x}, y)$. Then, it adjusts\n",
